# Arc XP iOS SDK
The primary Arc XP framework for Apple platforms.
Arc XP services included with this framework are Commerce, Content, and Video services.


A collection of documentation covering the Arc XP unified mobile SDK and sample projects.

## Backend Setup

Before any of Arc XP's services can be used, a backend must be ready to connect to. See the reference below for more details. If you're only developing for iOS and Android platforms, you shouldn't need to do any backend setup, and will simply need the backend configuration details to use the SDK. 

* [Backend setup for Mobile SDK](https://dev.arcxp.com/mobile/content/back-end-setup-for-mobile-sdk/)
* [Mobile SDK - Resolver setup](https://dev.arcxp.com/mobile/content/mobile-sdk-resolver-setup/)

## Mobile SDK

This project is open sourced, so feel free to add as a submodule to your android project.
Alternatively, you can compile your own binary and include in your project.


Arc XP's Mobile SDK allows access to Arc XP services and content, for Android and iOS applications. Access to the various services and media is available via a single SDK, documentation can be found around the following modules (commerce/content being optional).

* **(Subscriptions)** Identity services for user management.
* **(Content)** Fetching media to display in applications.
* **(Video)** Fetching video on demand, and connecting to livestreams.

## Sample Apps

Arc XP's mobile sample apps demonstrate what using Arc XP services in real world applications might look like, while also providing a starting point for updating and customizing the project into something more suited to a specific client.

When it comes to cross platform development and using our mobile SDK we have experimented with React Native and found a way to incorporate our SDK into a RN project. Please see the article here: [Using Mobile SDK with React Native](https://dev.arcxp.com/mobile/additional-resources/using-mobile-sdk-with-react-native/)

### The Arc XP - News App

The Arc XP News demonstrates Arc XP services built into a mobile news app.
